Electronic IOT and Embedded Systems (EIES) Mini-Elevator Project
This project is the design and fabrication of a mini elevator system for the partial fulfillment of the course Electronic IOT and Embedded Systems (EIES). The word ‘Mini’ implies that the elevator system would be scaled to a portable size such that it can easily be moved into the electronic laboratory for all necessary tests and evaluations. Though scaled down dimensionally, it would, beyond expectation, effectively give all the functionalities like those of a standard elevator.
Consequently, there is a need to fabricate the mechanical parts, which include the carriage, the frame, and the pulley. Then install the direct current (DC) motor, pullies, and the corresponding brackets. The notarization is implemented with the use of a microprocessor (Arduino Uno) in addition to some other sensors to enable the required feedback and disturbance rejection.
Brevity aims to build the plant, implement control through microprocessors and smart sensors, and then compare the theoretical results with the physical results.
